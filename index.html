            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>1. What is Meme Generator AI?</h3>
            <p>Meme Generator AI is a fun and creative app that uses AI to help you generate hilarious and viral memes from your ideas or prompts.</p>

            <h3>2. Does the app collect or store any personal data?</h3>
            <p>No. We do not collect or store your personal data. All content stays on your device unless you choose to save or share it.</p>

            <h3>3. How does the meme generation work?</h3>
            <p>We use third-party AI services to process your input and generate memes. This data is only used temporarily for generating the meme and is not saved or reused.</p>

            <h3>4. Why does the app need media access?</h3>
            <p>We request access to your photo library or storage only when you want to save or share a meme. Your files are never uploaded or shared without your action.</p>

            <h3>5. Are there any in-app purchases?</h3>
            <p>Yes, premium features may be available via in-app purchases handled securely through the App Store. We donâ€™t handle or store any payment information ourselves.</p>

            <h3>6. Is there a daily generation limit?</h3>
            <p>Yes, to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the app has a daily generation cap of 50 memes per user. This helps us manage costs and keep the service smooth and accessible for everyone.</p>
